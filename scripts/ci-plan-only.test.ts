 * The asymmetry here is the whole point. A false negative (calling a plan-only PR
 * "code") costs ~20 minutes of runner time and nothing else. A false positive
 * (calling a code PR "plan-only") silences build, typecheck, lint, the unit suites
 * and all three end-to-end suites on a change that could break any of them, while
 * every required context still reports green. So every case below that is not
